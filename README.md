<p>...some words </p>
This project was started in 2010 at the beginning of my PhD thesis to support my work
on Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI).
The understanding of dynamic magnetic fields and their influence on the magnetization
response of superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are an esential part
to develop hardware in this field.
With this still growing framework, me and my group could find not only novel designs
and theories but also emulating MPI and MPS systems, which has been successfully built.
